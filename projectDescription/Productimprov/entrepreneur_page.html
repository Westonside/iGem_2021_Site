                                                                phase 2 project, we decided to continue this and give suggestions on how the weaknesses could be addressed and what general improvements can be made, focussing on the product. The 
                                                                PESTEL analysis was also considered when finding improvements. </p>

                        <p class = "article_content after_head">The biggest factor that could impact our product is the further banning of toxic sunscreen chemicals such as ZnO. Hawaii has already banned the selling of sunscreen containing oxybenzone and octinoxate,
                             a law that came into effect 1st of January 2021 (HNN Staff, 2021) and Palau was the first country to ban “reef-toxic” sunscreen in 2020 (BBC, 2020). This would likely make Shinescreen more attractive as other companies have to rebrand and 
                             remake their formulas while Shinescreen is already on the market. It will also help the reef-safe sunscreen market grow as there will be a bigger interest meaning that we will have a greater chance to receive funding to develop our concept and formula. </p>

                        <h4 class = "sub_section_title">Negative view of GMOs</h4>
                        
                        <p class = "article_content">The way to prevent negative views of GMOs is to open a discussion about GMOs and bring up realistic threats, to give people the chance to make an opinion. This can be demonstrated from last year, which showed that 30% would be more 
                            comfortable with using GMO products, and 50% would be open to using cosmetics that used GMOs (iGEM St Andrews 2020, 2020). This was shown after hosting a synthetic biology forum where they invited experts within the field to provide the attendees with different 
                            views of GMOs. Thus, by incorporating an education and outreach program relating to our project, we hope that more people will make educated decisions when choosing if they want to use our product or not. In this year’s project we aim to produce educational material 
                            regarding the Shinescreen project and synthetic biology. One of the target groups we chose was mom and baby groups, as they have the purchasing power to buy sustainable sunscreen and vegans. More can be read under Human Practices. </p>

                        <h4 class = "sub_section_title">Research and Development funding shortage</h4>
                        <p class = "article_content after_head">In order to ensure that funding will not run out a long-term sponsor or partner should be found. To do this, the team should reach out to companies and governmental bodies to pitch the idea. However, more research that would acquire proof
                             of concept should be made before pitching to larger investors. A patent could not be acquired last year due to a lack of proof of a concept, and therefore going to investors with the aim of a long-term partnership would most likely end up with the same result. </p>

                        <h4 class = "sub_section_title">Legislation</h4>
                        <p class = "article_content after_head">As cosmetic legislation is complex, and we would need a lawyer or someone with legal expertise that would guide us through what the current regulations are. As we aim to launch our product in the United Kingdom first and later to the rest of Europe.
                             We therefore must consider both the United Kingdom’s regulations as well as the European Union’s. For example, the regulations from the United Kingdom states “A product must be safe for human health under normal and reasonably foreseeable conditions of use” (Office for Product and Safety & Standards, 2021). 
                             Meaning that we need to ensure that Shinorine and other compounds that we add must be tested for safety before the sunscreen’s launch. For instance, if we use non-nano-zinc oxide, we need to ensure it is safe for human health. Moreover, there are many more regulations that we must consider such as packaging symbols 
                             and cosmetic product safety assessment. </p>

                        <h4 class = "sub_section_title">Packaging</h4>

                        <p class = "article_content after_head">A future threat with the product is the use of non-eco-friendly packaging, like plastic, which would erupt a backlash to the whole company and counteract the positive change that we are aiming to achieve. Additionally, 
                            in the interview with Rick Babel, the CEO of the sunscreen company Mama Kuleana, he mentioned that a key element for our product’s success is the packaging. Without eco-friendly packaging, the eco-friendly product would be wasteful. Consequently, the team aim to 
                            develop biodegradable packaging and cream using raw and natural products in the future. The material for the bottle could be packaging or corn starch for example.</p>

                        <h4 class = "sub_section_title">Product Shelf Life</h4>


                        <p class = "article_content after_head">In an interview with Ingmar Claes, Chief Scientific Officer at YUN cosmetics, he told us that another important part of designing a cosmetics product is the shelf life. In his opinion, the general shelf life of commercial cosmetic
                             products is 18 months (though this would vary based on our specific bacteria and storage methods). Especially if we are dealing with probiotic bacteria shelf life is vital, for if our product exceeds its shelf life the bacteria would no longer be viable.</p>

                        <p class = "article_content after_head">Our team came up with a few possible solutions to maintaining shelf life and how to store the bacteria. These potential methods include freeze-drying and micro-encapsulation.</p>

                        <p class = "article_content after_head">For the freeze-drying method, compatible solutes would be added to the cream to preserve the bacteria. It has shown that the addition of trehalose can improve the survival of E.Coli NISSLE 1917 when freeze-dried. Another method would be
                             to air dry the bacteria and add protective solutes (Louis, Trüper and Galinski, 1994). </p>

                        <p class = "article_content after_head">Our team learned about Microencapsulation from Ingmar Claes (at YUN Probiotherapy), as this technique is used to preserve the active strains of live probiotic bacteria present in their cosmetics. The basis of this process is that the bacteria
                             are first deactivated and later stabilized by microencapsulation. When the product is opened the bacteria will reactivate and can be applied to the skin. It would also allow us to produce a water-based cream and keep the bacteria alive.</p>

                             <p class = "article_content after_head">Nevertheless, more research and testing must be done to determine the most optimal method. </p>
