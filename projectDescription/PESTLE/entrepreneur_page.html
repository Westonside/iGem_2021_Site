                                                                factors that could affect the success of a business or organisation (Business to you, 2016) This is used as a complementary to last year’s <a href = "https://2020.igem.org/Team:St_Andrews/Human_Practices">SWOT</a> analysis. </p>


                        <p class = "article_content">PESTEL is an acronym that stands for Political, Economic, Social, Technology, Environment and Legal, which are macro factors that can influence the performance of an organization in a market.</p>

                        <p class = "article_content after_head">The biggest factor that could impact our product is the further banning of toxic sunscreen chemicals such as ZnO. Hawaii has already banned the selling of sunscreen containing oxybenzone and octinoxate,
                             a law that came into effect 1st of January 2021 (HNN Staff, 2021) and Palau was the first country to ban “reef-toxic” sunscreen in 2020 (BBC, 2020). This would likely make Shinescreen more attractive as other companies have to rebrand and 
                             remake their formulas while Shinescreen is already on the market. It will also help the reef-safe sunscreen market grow as there will be a bigger interest meaning that we will have a greater chance to receive funding to develop our concept and formula. </p>


                        <p class = "article_content">Another significant factor is if different countries decide to implement stricter rules to try to reduce covid cases such as national lockdowns or more requirements if you wish to enter a certain country, which would reduce tourism.
                            In turn, it would reduce the demand for sunscreen as people do not travel to warm places for holidays. Even in warm places, the demand for sunscreen would decrease as people are forced to spend less time outside. </p>

                                                                however, due to the pandemic, there has been a significant drop in demand and sales. In the US alone the sales for sunscreen dropped by almost 20%. On account of this, continuation of the pandemic 
                                                                would most likely continue this trend and making it hard for us to launch our sunscreen because the fall the in demand (Fact.MR, 2020). </p>
